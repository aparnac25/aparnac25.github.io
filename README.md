# Population History

Ranomafana National Park (RNP) has one of the highest levels of primate
biodiversity in the world, containing thirteen species of lemurs, three
of which are critically endangered. While over 50% of the park is
primary forest, the remainder has been subject to varying levels of
logging and other anthropogenic and natural disturbance. To evaluate the
effect of these pressures, we are reconstructing population demography
across five diurnal lemur species. Thsese species -- Milne Edwards' sifakas (_Propithecus
edwardsi_), brown lemurs (_Eulemur rufifrons_), red-bellied lemurs (_Eulemur
rubriventer_), bamboo lemurs (_Hapalemur griseus_), and ruffed lemurs
(_Varecia variegata_) vary in size, locomotor pattern, dietary
diversity, and life history variables.
